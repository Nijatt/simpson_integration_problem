# simpson_integration_problem
An example problem: Simpsons Integration with validity test.  


Develop a program that can calculate the integral with a given integrand f(x)
    in the region [a, b] by the Simpson rule with nonuniform data points.
    Check its accuracy with the integral of e^(x)dx from zero to infinity
    with x_j=j*h*e^(j*alpha), where h and alpha are small constants.
